# Family History Research Strategies

Advanced research methodologies and strategic approaches for effective family history and genealogy research.

## Core Research Principles

### 1. FAN Principle (Family, Associates, Neighbors)

Research the network around your ancestor, not just the ancestor alone.

**Family:**
- Parents, siblings, spouses, children
- In-laws and step-relations
- Aunts, uncles, cousins
- Godparents and guardians

**Associates:**
- Business partners
- Witnesses to documents
- Executors of wills
- Bond co-signers
- Fellow church members

**Neighbors:**
- Clustered in census records
- Adjacent land owners
- Same community institutions
- Migration companions

**Why It Works:**
- Family left records when ancestor didn't
- Associates provide clues to ancestor's activities
- Neighbors help locate ancestor geographically
- Network reveals relationships and context

**Application:**
When researching John Smith:
- Search for all Smith siblings in same records
- Find witnesses on John's marriage record
- Research neighbors from 1850 census
- Track godparents named in baptism records

### 2. Cluster Genealogy

Study your ancestor within their social cluster.

**Identify Clusters:**
- Same surname in locality
- Repeated witnesses across documents
- Adjacent land owners
- Same migration patterns
- Common church/organization membership

**Track Clusters:**
- Follow cluster through records
- Note when cluster members separate
- Identify cluster leaders/patriarchs
- Map cluster relationships

**Benefits:**
- Reveals family connections
- Provides context for decisions
- Helps distinguish same-name individuals
- Suggests migration routes and destinations

### 3. Reasonably Exhaustive Research

Work systematically through source types and locations.

**Source Prioritization:**

**Tier 1 - Essential (search first):**
- Census records
- Vital records
- Major events (birth, marriage, death)
- Land records
- Probate records

**Tier 2 - Important (search next):**
- Church records
- Military records
- Immigration/naturalization
- Newspapers
- City directories

**Tier 3 - Contextual (as needed):**
- Court records
- Tax records
- School records
- Business records
- Organization memberships

**Tier 4 - Supplemental (for difficult cases):**
- Published histories
- Compiled genealogies
- DNA evidence
- Archaeological evidence
- Oral histories

### 4. Work Backward from Known to Unknown

Start with what you know for certain and work backward chronologically.

**Process:**
1. Establish identity of known person with documentation
2. Find parent-child connections
3. Verify each generation before moving back
4. Don't skip generations based on assumptions

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Working forward from early immigrant
- ❌ Assuming surname means relation
- ❌ Skipping generations
- ❌ Starting with others' research without verification

## Geographic Strategies

### 1. Migration Tracking

Follow ancestors through geographic movement.

**Migration Clues:**
- Birth places of children (show movement)
- Land sales and purchases
- Changing census locations
- Probate records show both origin and destination
- Newspaper notices of arrivals/departures

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Chain migration (following relatives/neighbors)
- Following transportation routes (rivers, roads, rails)
- Moving to similar geography/climate
- Seeking specific resources (farmland, mining, manufacturing)

**Research Strategy:**
1. Establish presence in each location with documentation
2. Search records in both origin and destination
3. Check intermediate locations along migration route
4. Research known migration patterns for time/place

### 2. Locality Research

Understand the history and records of each location.

**Priority Resources (use these first):**
- [FamilySearch Wiki](https://www.familysearch.org/wiki/) - Comprehensive locality guides, record information, and research strategies for locations worldwide
- [LDSgenealogy.com](https://ldsgenealogy.com/) - State-specific research guides and record information
  - Example: [Pennsylvania Research](https://ldsgenealogy.com/PA/)
  - Includes county formation, record repositories, and research strategies

**Essential Background:**
- County formation history (which county existed when?)
- Record losses (fires, floods, wars)
- Record repositories (where records are now)
- Boundary changes (did location change counties?)
- Local history (economic, social, religious factors)

**Research Guides:**
- Red Book (American State, County & Town Sources)
- Wiki sites (FamilySearch Wiki, county wikis)
- State archives research guides
- Local historical society resources

### 3. Jurisdictional Strategy

Understand which jurisdiction created which records.

**Typical Jurisdictions:**
- **Federal**: Census, military, immigration, tax
- **State**: Vital records, land grants, institutions
- **County**: Deeds, probate, court, marriages
- **Town/City**: Local vital records, directories, newspapers
- **Church/Private**: Baptisms, marriages, burials

**Research Implication:**
Know which level of government to search for each record type.

## Record-Specific Strategies

### Census Research

**Complete Census Search:**
- Search every census year person was alive
- Include mortality schedules
- Check agricultural/industrial schedules
- Search state/territorial censuses

**Techniques:**
- Browse entire enumeration district (find neighbors)
- Check indexes AND browse images (transcription errors)
- Note all household members and relationships
- Track household composition changes
- Compare across multiple censuses

**Common Issues:**
- Name variations/misspellings
- Age inconsistencies
- Enumeration errors
- Missing enumerations

### Land Records Research

**Deed Research Strategy:**
- Search both grantee (buyer) and grantor (seller) indexes
- Read complete deeds for family relationships
- Note witnesses (often family)
- Check adjoining land owners
- Follow land through generations

**Beyond Deeds:**
- Tax records (prove ownership without deed)
- Plat maps (show locations)
- Homestead files (rich detail)
- Military bounty land (connects to service)

### Probate Research

**Comprehensive Probate Search:**
- Search by name of deceased
- Search by administrator/executor (might be relative serving)
- Check probate packets (complete files, not just indexed wills)
- Search guardianship records (minor children)
- Check estate settlements (years after death)

**Information in Probate:**
- Family relationships explicitly stated
- Property distribution reveals family structure
- Witnesses often family members
- Dates of death
- Financial status

### Church Records

**Church Record Strategy:**
- Identify denomination through other records
- Find church locations using maps/histories
- Check multiple churches in area
- Search for original records and published abstracts

**Record Types:**
- Baptism/christening (shows parents, godparents)
- Marriage (shows families of both parties)
- Burial (shows death date, age)
- Membership lists (show arrivals/departures)
- Church minutes (context about families)

## Brick Wall Strategies

When research stalls, try these approaches:

### 1. Re-analyze Existing Evidence

- Review all sources collected
- Look for overlooked clues
- Reconsider interpretations
- Check for indirect evidence

### 2. Expand Geographic Search

- Search neighboring counties
- Check origin and destination states
- Research migration routes
- Try unexpected locations

### 3. Expand Time Frame

- Search earlier than expected (age errors)
- Search later (delayed recording)
- Check surrounding decades

### 4. Research Collateral Lines

- Focus on siblings who left more records
- Research spouse's family
- Study children's records for clues

### 5. Alternative Name Strategies

- Try phonetic spellings
- Check nickname variations
- Search for maiden names
- Consider name changes

### 6. Non-Traditional Sources

- Newspapers (obituaries, notices, ads)
- City directories (occupation, residence)
- Organization records (memberships)
- School records
- Employment records
- DNA evidence

### 7. Hire Local Researcher

- Access to repositories you can't visit
- Knowledge of local records
- Understanding of local history
- Reading old handwriting

## Documentation Strategies

### Research Logs

**Essential Elements:**
- Date of research session
- Sources searched (positive and negative)
- Search terms and variations used
- Results found (or not found)
- Next steps identified

**Benefits:**
- Avoid duplicate searches
- Track strategies tried
- Document thorough research
- Support GPS compliance

### Source Organization

**System Requirements:**
- Consistent citation format
- Cross-referencing between sources
- Tagging/categorizing by person, place, type
- Linking sources to conclusions

**Tools:**
- Genealogy software
- Spreadsheets
- Cloud storage
- Physical filing system

### Evidence Tracking

**Organize Evidence By:**
- Individual person
- Research question
- Source type
- Time period
- Geographic location

**Track:**
- What source says (exact information)
- Your interpretation
- Reliability assessment
- Connections to other sources
- Questions raised

## Advanced Strategies

### 1. Negative Evidence Strategy

Use absence of information as evidence.

**Examples:**
- Person not in census (suggests death or migration)
- Not in probate records (died without estate)
- Not in church records (different denomination)
- Missing from land records (renter not owner)

**Application:**
Absence of John in 1880 census but present in 1870 suggests:
- Death between 1870-1880
- Migration out of area
- Enumeration error
Next: Search death records, neighboring counties

### 2. Timeline Construction

Build comprehensive timeline of ancestor's life.

**Include:**
- Known facts with dates
- Implied facts (birth from age)
- Contextual events
- Family member events
- Historical context

**Analysis:**
- Identify date conflicts
- Spot gaps in knowledge
- Recognize patterns
- Test logical consistency

### 3. Hypothesis Testing

Formulate and test specific hypotheses.

**Process:**
1. State hypothesis specifically
2. Identify what evidence would support it
3. Identify what evidence would contradict it
4. Search for both supporting and contradicting evidence
5. Evaluate results objectively

**Example:**
Hypothesis: "John Smith was son of William Smith of Pennsylvania"
Supporting evidence: Similar names, right time/place, DNA match
Contradicting evidence: William's will doesn't mention John
Result: Hypothesis needs revision

### 4. DNA Strategy

Use genetic genealogy to complement documentary research.

**DNA Applications:**
- Confirm family relationships
- Break through brick walls
- Identify unknown parents
- Distinguish same-name individuals
- Find living cousins with information

**Important:**
- DNA doesn't replace documentary research
- Requires DNA literacy and understanding
- Consider privacy and ethical issues
- Best used with strong paper trail

## Research Planning

### Project-Based Research

**Define Project:**
- Specific research question
- Scope and limitations
- Expected sources
- Timeline and milestones

**Advantages:**
- Focused effort
- Measurable progress
- Prevents research sprawl
- Supports GPS compliance

### Iterative Research

Research in cycles, not linear progression.

**Cycle:**
1. **Plan**: Identify sources to search
2. **Search**: Execute research plan
3. **Analyze**: Evaluate findings
4. **Document**: Record results and reasoning
5. **Revise**: Update plan based on findings
6. **Repeat**: Next research cycle

### Collaboration Strategies

**Effective Collaboration:**
- Share sources and citations
- Respect others' privacy and wishes
- Cite others' contributions
- Verify independently
- Contribute to community

**Resources:**
- Online forums and groups
- Local genealogy societies
- Surname studies
- DNA project groups
- Academic partnerships

## Efficiency Strategies

### Batch Research

**Group by:**
- Repository (research all at one archive)
- Source type (all census at once)
- Location (all records for one county)
- Time period (all 1850s records)

### Online Research Optimization

**Effective Searching:**
- Use wildcards for name variations
- Try different date ranges
- Search phonetically
- Browse, don't just search
- Check multiple databases

**Time Management:**
- Set specific research goals
- Limit browsing time
- Take organized notes
- Schedule focused sessions
- Balance online and offline research
